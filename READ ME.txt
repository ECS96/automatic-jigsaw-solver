Jigsaw Puzzle Problem Implementation 

This Program uses OpenCV and I'm not sure if this code is portable with the manually installed libraries

This project was build in Visual Studio.

In OpenCVProject2 Folder Open the OpenCVProject2.sln in Visual Studio

To run the program the full paths to the images need to be set. 

The source directory needs to be added where the 826723 project zip was extracted

In Main.cpp and ImageOperations.Cpp change the sourceDir string to the full path of the location to the extracted 826723 folder

If project folder is in "Your/Own/Source/Directory/826723/automatic-jigsaw-solver/..."

example: String sourceDir = "Your/Own/Source/Directory";

Recompile and Run program with Ctrl+F5

The program should be run in Debug x64 and from Main.cpp

If the program cannot be run then all outputs of the program can be found from the last successful run.

Images for all stages of image processing and data extraction are found in the Final Jigsaw Scans Folder:
Original Images, Canny Output, Contours, Corners, Edges, Gaussian and Threshold images are all stored.

Types detected for each piece and edge are stored in the OpenCVProject2 folder in types.txt

All Scores calculated in matching are found in the OpenCVProject2 folder in allscores.txt and bestscores.txt
